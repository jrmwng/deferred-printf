# Deferred Printf

## Overview
The Deferred Printf project implements a deferred output mechanism in C++. This allows for the accumulation of output data that can be printed later, providing flexibility in how and when output is displayed.

## Project Structure

## Files Description

- **src/deferred_printf.cpp**: Implements the functionality of the deferred printf feature. It includes the logic for handling deferred output and defines helper functions.

- **include/deferred_printf.h**: Declares the interface for the deferred printf functionality. It exports functions and possibly classes related to deferred printing.

- **CMakeLists.txt**: Configuration file for CMake. It specifies the project name, version, and the source files to be compiled.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd deferred-printf
   ```

3. Create a build directory and navigate into it:
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

4. Run CMake to configure the project:
   ```
   cmake ..
   ```

5. Build the project:
   ```
   make
   ```

## Usage
After building the project, you can use the deferred printf functionality by including the `deferred_printf.h` header in your source files and using the provided functions.

Example:
```cpp
#include "deferred_printf.h"

int main() {
    jrmwng::deferred_printf<> dp;
    dp("Hello, ");
    dp("world!");
    dp.apply(&vprintf);
    return 0;
}
```
